## Introduction
This project aims to analyze historical economic data to predict recessions using machine learning techniques. By leveraging various algorithms and statistical methods, we've developed a model that can forecast economic downturns with reasonable accuracy. Additionally, we've deployed this model for easy access and visualization.

## Future Scope
The project has immense potential for expansion and improvement. Some future enhancements could include:
- Incorporating more sophisticated machine learning models for better predictions.
- Integrating real-time economic indicators for more accurate forecasts.
- Building a user-friendly web interface for easier interaction with the model.
- Expanding analysis to include regional or sector-specific recessions.

## Vision
Our vision is to provide policymakers, economists, and businesses with a reliable tool for anticipating recessions and making informed decisions to mitigate their impact. By harnessing the power of machine learning and data analysis, we strive to contribute to economic stability and resilience.
